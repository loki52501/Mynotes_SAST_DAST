# Mynotes_SAST_DAST

This is a project, that is mainly focused on SAST and DAST. using ZAP(DAST) and codeql. As the project is deep with use of nodejs, postgres and react js, it mainly focuses on, what are the vulnerabilites that a normal web application like mine would incur, and what changes i need to make after each iteration, which is kept track by the git.
